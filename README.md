# ScoreKeeper

This is a site where you can track your score while you play a game.

1. I used HTML for the structure of the website.
2. I used Bulma for the styling.
3. I used JavaScript so that when the buttons are clicked the score changes and when the player wins they cannot click anymore. Also you can set the "play until" score which is also coded through JavaScript
